# Monty Hall Simulation Backend

This is the backend for the Monty Hall simulation web application. The backend is responsible for running the simulations of the Monty Hall problem and returning the results to the frontend.

## Overview

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle where a contestant is presented with three doors. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two are goats. After the contestant picks a door, the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat. The contestant then has the choice to stick with their original pick or switch to the other unopened door.

This backend service handles the logic of the game and can simulate a large number of games to determine the probability of winning by switching or not switching doors.
